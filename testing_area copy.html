	  <h1>Cultural Significance</h1>
				<p> 	Nelson Mandela once said <i>“Sports have the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire, the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sports can create hope, where there was once only despair. It is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers. It laughs in the face of all types of discrimination. Sports is the game of lovers.” </i> </p>

				<p>David Crombie Park is a 1.6 hectare (3.95 acres) linear park in east downtown Toronto that functions as the green spine of the St Lawrence Market Neighbourhood. David Crombie Park is situated within an area of cultural and heritage significance. It is located just south of the original footprint of Old Town Toronto.</p>

				<p>The park was built in 1977 and is named after David Crombie, who, during his successive three terms as mayor of Toronto (1972-1978), had taken a leadership role in the redevelopment of the neighbourhood that surrounds the park. </p>

				<p>David Crombie Park is a very well used and loved neighbourhood park. It also provides a popular green corridor promenade for tourists and residents to walk between the downtown core to neighbourhoods east of the park.</p>

				<p> The park is located south of Front Street and is bounded by Lower Jarvis and Esplanade at its west end, and by Hahn Place and Scadding Avenue at its east end. Bordered by streets on almost all of the park edges, with consistent built street wall of 6-8 stories, the park plan was designed as an integral component of the ground-breaking design of the mixed-income and mixed-use St. Lawrence Neighbourhood to maximize eyes on the park and provide an attractive green view to the many residents and commercial tenants facing the park. </p>

				<p>The park is named after David Crombie, who, during his successive three term as mayor of Toronto, had taken a leadership role in the redevelopment of the neighbourhood that surrounds the park. The efforts of Crombie and his colleagues, to preserve the human scale of the neighbourhood, and keep it liveable, are widely praised, in retrospect. The neighbourhood has been called "the gold standard for mixed development" and <i>"the best example of a mixed-income, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly, sensitively scaled, densely populated community ever built in the province."</i>This revitalization project allowed for people from all sort of socio-economic statuses, race and ethnicity to reject all forms of discrimination and unite over the love of basketball with this beautifully designed park. </p>

				<p>The David Crombie Park Revitalization Design is led by the City. Local community groups and the general public are important participants in the project. </p>
